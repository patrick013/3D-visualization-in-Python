## Tasks
#### This section contains a set of programming challenges. Complete as many steps as you can, feel free to skip any tasks you are unsure of how to complete. Make sure to read all sub tasks before starting. Tasks denoted with a * are bonus tasks. I will be evaluating code readability and structure as much as functionality.

#### 3D scan feature detection
* Given this scan file visualize the raw data in a 3D graph.
* Automatically detect the separate sections of the scan and visualize them in separate 3D graphs. There should be 5 distinct sections in total.
* Plot of the face of each section in a 2D graph.
* Clean up the noise on each section so the 2D graphs are smoother.
* *3 of the 5 sections have some dimples inset into the shape. Detect the radius of these dimples.
* *Extrapolate the 2D graphs to extend an extra 1000 points farther than their current start and end.
